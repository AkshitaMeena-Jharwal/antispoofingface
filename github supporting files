# Contributing to Face Anti-Spoofing System

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/yourusername/face-anti-spoofing-system/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/face-anti-spoofing-system/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)

## Code Style

* Use Black for Python code formatting
* Follow PEP 8 guidelines
* Add type hints where appropriate
* Write descriptive docstrings

## Testing

* Write tests for new features
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Aim for good test coverage
